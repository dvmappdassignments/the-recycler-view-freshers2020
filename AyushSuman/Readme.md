# The Recycler View

## Why Recycler View?
The Recyler View is a very powerful tool. Almost every app that contains a list of items uses it.  
The major advantage is the memory efficiency it provides as compared to a simple List View. Also, it is very flexible in nature, leading to it's immense popularity

## The task
You have to create a **Notes App**, similar to the one given during your recruitment tasks, but this time **using a Recycler View**.  
The app should **Add, and Delete Notes**. On clicking on any one of the notes, **a new Activity is to be opened**.  
Also, if you have time, try to include **two different styles of notes in your app**.  
In any case however, make sure to read about the **best practices for communicating between a recycler view and an Activity**.  
Also, we expect you all to **handle as many errors as possible**, so that no matter what the user does, your app should not loose its functionality.
